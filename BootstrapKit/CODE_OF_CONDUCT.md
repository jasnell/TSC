## Working Group Code of Conduct Template

Every Working Group must have a Code of Conduct. By default,
all repositories under the Node.js GitHub Organization fall under
the [Node.js Code of Conduct][], but Working Groups can choose to
define their own alternative policy. If the Working Group does choose
it's own Code of Conduct, it must be documented in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
file located in the root of any repository under their stewardship.

### Template: *[insert WG name]* Code of Conduct

The [Node.js Code of Conduct][] applies to this WG.
