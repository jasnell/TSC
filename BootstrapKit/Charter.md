## Working Group Charter Template

Every Working Group requires a charter that describes the scope of
the WGs responsibilities. Once written, a new Pull Request that adds
the charter to either the CTC or TSC WORKING_GROUPS.md document must
be opened. The WG is considered to be officially chartered once the
PR adding the proposed charter is landed and merged into the relevant
WORKING_GROUPS.md document

### Template: *[insert WG name]* Working Group

The Node.js *[insert WG name]* is jointly governed by a Working Group (WG)
that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The WG has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of WG members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#current-project-team-members).
