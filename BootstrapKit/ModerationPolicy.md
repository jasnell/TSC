## Working Group Moderation Policy Template

Every Working Group must have a Moderation Policy. By default,
all repositories under the Node.js GitHub Organization fall under
the [Node.js Moderation Policy][], but Working Groups can choose to
define their own alternative policy. If the Working Group does choose
it's own Moderation Policy, it must be documented in a `ModerationPolicy.md`
file located in the root of any repository under their stewardship.

### Template: *[insert WG name]* Moderation Policy

The [Node.js Moderation Policy] applies to this WG.
