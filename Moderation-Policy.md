## Moderation policy

### Applicability

By default, this policy applies to all repositories under the Node.js Github Organization and all Node.js Working Groups.

Individual Working Groups and Top Level Projects chartered by the TSC may adopt an alternative Moderation Policy for any repository under their stewardship so long as:
* The Moderation Policy is openly documented as part of the Working Group or Project Charter and;
* Includes provisions for clearly and openly documenting Moderation actions taken.

### Terms

* "Collaborator" refers to any individual member or "outside collaborator" of the Node.js Github Organization.
* "Post" refers to the content of any issue, pull request or comment.
* "Moderate" refers to the act of modifying the content of or deleting any Post that is in obvious violation of the Node.js Code of Conduct.
* "Ban" refers to the act of blocking an individual Github account from any further participation in the Node.js Github Organization.

### Policy

* All Posts are expected to respect the Node.js Code of Conduct.
* Only Collaborators with commit rights to a given repository may Moderate Posts within that repository's issue tracker.
* Collaborator's must not Moderate any Post authored by another Collaborator without first giving the author an opportunity of at least 24 hours to modify or remove the Post on their own. In extreme circumstances the TSC can be consulted to waive the 24 hour grace period.
* Posts authored by non-Collaborator's are always subject to immediate Moderation by any Collaborator if the content is intentionally disruptive or in violation of the Node.js Code of Conduct.
* When Moderating any Post authored by another Collaborator, the moderating Collaborator must:
 * Explain the justification for Moderating the post,
 * Identify all changes made to the Post, and
 * Identify the steps previously taken to resolve the issue.
* When Moderating non-Collaborator Posts, the moderating Collaborator should:
 * Explain the justification for Moderating the post, and
 * Identify all changes made to the Post.
* Explanations of Moderation actions on Collaborator Posts must be provided in:
 * A new post within the original thread, or
 * A new issue within the private nodejs/moderation repository.
* Explanations of Moderation actions for non-Collaborator Posts must be provided in:
 * The original Post being modified (as replacement or appended content),
 * A new post within the original thread, or
 * A new issue within the private nodejs/moderation repository.
* Any Collaborator who habitually authors Posts that must be Moderated will be subject to possible removal from the Node.js Github Organization. Such action can only be taken through normal TSC motion and vote.
* Moderation of Posts authored by non-Collaborators may result in those non-Collaborators being Banned from further participation in the Node.js Github Organization for an indefinite period of time.
* Only a TSC member may Ban an individual from the Node.js Github Organization.

### Privacy of the nodejs/moderation Repository

The nodejs/moderation Repository is used to discuss the details of any specific proposed or actual Moderation or Banning action. The repository is private but accessible to all Collaborators. The details of any issue discussed within the nodejs/moderation repository are expected to remain confidential and are not to be discussed in any external or public forum.

### Modifications to This Policy

Modifications to this policy are made through normal TSC motion and vote. Any Collaborator may submit a PR proposing changes to this policy. Those PRs must be labeled using the `tsc-agenda` label.
